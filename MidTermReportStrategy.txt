MP.1 Data Buffer Optimization
    From my point of view, a proper data estructure (FIFO) should be used (std::queue). 
    After inserting a new item, if the vector is "full" of elements (N), then the first elements are 
    removed until we have space for the new element.   
MP.2 Keypoint Detection
    Implement detectors based on code from previous labs.
MP.3 Keypoint Removal
    Uses Rect.contains to check if all the keypoint are located inside the roi
MP.4 Keypoint Descriptors
    Implement descriptors based on code from previous labs or from opencv help (https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.0/d7/d7a/group__xfeatures2d__experiment.html)
MP.5 Descriptor Matching
    Implement detectors based on code from previous labs and code based on opencv example https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d5/d6f/tutorial_feature_flann_matcher.html
MP.6 Descriptor Distance Ratio
Some descriptor and extractors are not compatible (https://github.com/kyamagu/mexopencv/issues/351)
