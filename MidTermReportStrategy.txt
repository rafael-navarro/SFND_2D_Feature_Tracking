MP.1 Data Buffer Optimization
    From my point of view, a proper data estructure (FIFO) should be used (std::queue). 
    After inserting a new item, if the vector is "full" of elements (N), then the first elements are 
    removed until we have space for the new element.   
MP.2 Keypoint Detection
    Implement detectors based on code from previous labs.
MP.3 Keypoint Removal
    Uses Rect.contains to check if all the keypoint are located inside the roi
